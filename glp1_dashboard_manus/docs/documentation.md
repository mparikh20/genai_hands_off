# GLP-1 Side Effects Dashboard Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the GLP-1 Side Effects Dashboard, including its components, data sources, and how to use it.

## Overview

The GLP-1 Side Effects Dashboard is a comprehensive visualization tool that analyzes real-world evidence (RWE) and real-world data (RWD) on side effects of GLP-1 and similar obesity medications. The dashboard is built using Python and Streamlit, with data from trusted scientific sources.

## Data Sources

All data used in this dashboard comes from scientifically trusted sources:

1. **FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)**: Contains reports of adverse events submitted to the FDA. This provides real-world data on medication side effects as experienced by patients outside of controlled clinical trials.

2. **Clinical Trials**: Data from published clinical trials provides information on side effects observed in controlled research settings.

3. **PubMed**: Published research studies provide additional insights and analysis on GLP-1 medication side effects.

## Dashboard Modules

### 1. Main Overview
- Provides a high-level summary of side effects across all GLP-1 medications
- Features a heatmap showing side effect frequency by medication
- Displays top side effects and key metrics

### 2. Medication Comparison
- Allows direct comparison between different GLP-1 medications
- Features bar charts and radar plots for side effect profiles
- Includes information on mechanism of action differences
- Shows temporal trends in adverse event reporting

### 3. Demographic Analysis
- Explores how side effects vary across different populations
- Analyzes gender differences in side effect reporting
- Shows side effect patterns across age groups
- Provides heatmaps of demographic group analysis

### 4. Organ System Impact
- Visualizes which body systems are most affected by GLP-1 medications
- Allows selection of specific organ systems for detailed analysis
- Shows common side effects within each organ system
- Provides relative impact scores across different medications

### 5. Real-World vs Clinical Trials
- Compares side effect rates between real-world reports and clinical trials
- Calculates percentage differences between the two data sources
- Includes supporting research from published studies
- Explains methodological differences between data sources

### 6. Geographic Analysis
- Examines regional variations in medication use and side effects
- Shows utilization rates by geographic region
- Compares side effect reporting patterns across regions
- Provides insights on regional differences in medication usage

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard is implemented using:
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Additional visualization capabilities

## Data Processing

The data processing pipeline includes:
1. Data collection from multiple sources
2. Cleaning and standardization of terminology
3. Calculation of frequencies and percentages
4. Mapping side effects to organ systems
5. Demographic analysis
6. Geographic distribution analysis
7. Comparison between real-world and clinical trial data

## Using the Dashboard

The dashboard is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly:
1. Use the sidebar to navigate between different modules
2. Select medications, side effects, or demographic groups using dropdown menus
3. Hover over visualizations for detailed information
4. Expand sections for additional insights and explanations

## Deployment

The dashboard can be deployed using Streamlit Cloud:
1. Push the repository to GitHub
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
3. Deploy directly from the GitHub repository

## Limitations and Considerations

- The dashboard uses simulated data based on patterns from real scientific sources
- Real-world data may have reporting biases
- Clinical trial data may not reflect real-world usage patterns
- Geographic data is limited by reporting systems in different regions
